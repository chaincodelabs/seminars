## Discussion Questions

### Trampoline Payments
1. Can trampoline payments be combined with AML to mitigate privacy issues?

### Rendezvous Routing
2. Can you explain rendezvous routing in plain English?
3. Would it make sense to chain multiple rendezvous meeting points?

### Watchtowers
5. How do watchtowers work with non-advertised channels when part of the graph is not known? Or with Trampoline when routing calculation is outsourced?
