## Discussion Questions

1. What is the 'Selfish Miner' attack? How does it work? Is it a real threat? Why or why not?
1. What is a share withholding attack? Why isn't it used more often? What is the defense?
1. Why is the blockheight now encoded in the coinbase transaction?
1. How can changes to Bitcoins p2p protocol effect mining?
1. Do pool parallelize work among client miner to avoid them starting on the same range of search space and so increase chance of finding a block?
1. What are 'Weak Blocks' and why are they used in pooled mining?
1. Consider the following scenario: Segwit2x didn’t happen (or miners didn’t throw in support for it) and UASF (BIP148) ended up causing a chain split on August 1st, 2017, with minority mining support (e.g. ~10-20%). What would likely happen as a result?
1. How far back into the past can the timestamp in blocks be? Is this validated? How can this be attacked?
1. Why must transaction unlocking scripts only push numbers to be relayed? What output scripts are 'IsStandard'?
1. Why must transactions be > 82 bytes to be relayed?
1. What is a BGP Hijack attack? What prevents it?
1. How is the P2Pool work? Advantages and disadvantages?
1. Why not encrypt all communications with pool operators?
1. Why would some miners use parts of the version field as a nonce? What effect did this have on nodes?
1. What is the difference between overt and covert ASIC Boost?
1. How does the FIBRE network work and what were the motivations to iterate on the original Relay Network?
1. Have we seen the difficulty retarget algorithm be manipulated in other projects? Is this a threat to Bitcoin?
